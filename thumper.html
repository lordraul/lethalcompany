            <p><span class="bold">Thumpers</span> are two-legged, highly aggressive <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. They might lack hearing but have incredible eyesight and move extremely quick, but struggle to maneuver around corners.</p>

                <p>Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. Their name comes from the fact that they must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.</p>
                <p>They are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can't easily track prey.</p>
                <p>Due to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that Halves are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.</p>
