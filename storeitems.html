			<h1>Store</h1>
            <p>The <span class="bold">Store</span> is a game mechanic in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a> that allows various items to be purchased.</p>
            
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Typing "store" into the Terminal will print a full list of the items available, including the current Profit Quota's rotation of ship decor and item sales.</p>
            <p>An item may be purchased by typing in its name (or short-handed by typing at least the first three letters (i.e. "fla" for the Flashlight or "pro" for the Pro-flashlight) and a message will then appear asking to confirm or deny the order (you can also shorthand confirming/denying an order by using "c" or "d"). Multiples of a singular item may be purchased at once by typing a number after the name, though multiple different items cannot be purchased with one command.</p>
            <p>Items will be shipped to the current <a href="moons.html">Moon</a> via the Delivery System; if ordering from Orbit, the shipment will wait until you land before the vehicle begins its descent. Multiple purchases made fast enough — or made before landing — will be batched into a singular shipment. Once the delivery vehicle lands, the items must be quickly retrieved from it before it takes off again; the rocket will leave regardless once 30 seconds has elapsed after it lands, and the Company does not refund incomplete deliveries.</p>
            <p>Only one delivery vehicle may land at a time; if an order contains more than 12 items, or if there is a delay between multiple purchases, the items will be split between multiple vehicles, with each one queued up to arrive shortly after the previous vehicle leaves.</p>
