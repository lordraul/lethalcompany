			<h1>Bracken</h1>
            <p><span class="bold">Brackens</span> are shadow, humanoid <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. They quietly stalk players in an attempt to snap their neck and drag away their corpses. They are discouraged by brief instances of eye contact, but prolonged eye contact will enrage them.</p>

            <div class="bestiary">
                <p>There is debate on the genus to which the Bracken belongs. It is a bipedal vertebrate with skin the color and texture of a red beet. The name is coined for what appear to be leaves protruding from its upper spine. The purpose of these is believed to be for intimidation, however not much is known about the specifics of bracken behavior due to its elusiveness and low population.</p>
                <p>We know a little from accounts by wildlife experts who have encountered it. It is a lone hunter with high intelligence. Its behavior can seem aloof; it exhibits high aggression even when unprovoked, yet quickly backs off when confronted. However, brackens are known to up their hostility when cornered or simply watched for a long time. It's theorized that upon death their bodies undergo a rapid decomposition process which is unique from other large animals.</p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="italic">Rapax-folium</span> roughly translates to "predatory leaf" in Latin.</li>
                <li>Due to a misunderstanding, the so-called "Bracken's Laugh" has nothing to do with the Bracken itself and is actually heard while insanity is high.</li>
                <li>There is a common myth about the "backrooms" room that suggests, when the room is present, the Bracken will almost always spawn.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The purpose of the "backrooms" room is currently unknown</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For its dying animation, the Bracken appears to crouch and disappear, leaving behind small gray particles. This references the Bestiary's claim that their bodies undergo rapid decomposition after death.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is possibly a reference to The Upturned, as when the Traveler dies, they kneel over and burst into ash.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
