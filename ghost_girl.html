            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>A simplified explanation for the logic of her behavior is that she is akin to a game of Hide and Seek, rather than a game of Tag as some would believe. This means that the targeted employee is the seeker, not the hider. Once engaged (the target looks at or approaches her), there is a chance she will start chasing them. She has 5 distinct behaviors: "Absent", "Staring", "Disappearing", "Vanishing", and "Chasing".</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Absent</h3>
            <p>The ghost girl begins in this state. She waits for 20 seconds, then attempts to select a spot to appear, repeatedly trying every 4 seconds. If the target player is in the facility, she will pick a spot in the facility. If they are in the ship, she will pick a spot on the surface. If they are outside the ship and facility, she will fail to appear. She will select AI navigation nodes with a clear line of sight between the target and her, but not within 8 units of the target, and not in the target's view: the target must either be looking more than 80 degrees away from the spot, or be more than 100 units away, or certain nonsolid foliage materials may break the line of sight for this check while not being considered for the previous line of sight check. This means that if the target player is in the ship and there's a shelf, a terminal, or even a shower (excluding the bunk bed) blocking the line of sight between them and the entrance, she will never appear, because no valid locations have line of sight to her. This is because the shower is internally treated as a material that blocks line of sight for the AIs, and she must choose a spot in line of sight to her target. Once she successfully selects a spot, she will switch to the Staring state.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Staring</h3>
            <p>In this state, she motionlessly rotates to face her target, and a heartbeat sound plays if they are looking at her. The target player is considered to be looking at her if they have an unbroken line of sight to her (foliage materials matter), and are either within 5 units of her and facing any direction or are within 100 units of her and facing within 60 degrees of her direction. She keeps an internal timer, which lasts 15 seconds when she is indoors, or 25 seconds when she is outdoors. When the timer runs out, she will switch to the Disappearing state. The timer runs at 3x speed when the player is out of line of sight (foliage materials don't matter), and 1.25x speed when the player is looking at her (if she doesn't start to chase).</p>
            <p>Quickly looking away does not help; She does not count how long her target looks at her. She is only counting how many stares in which she was seen, and how many in which she was not seen. When looked at, if she has had at least 3 or 4 stares in which she was seen (3 or 4 is randomly selected with 50% chance), or at least 3 stares in which she was not seen, she has an 85% chance to go into the Chasing state. This is only rolled once per stare.</p>
            <p>Additionally, if the target player moves within 7 units of her, and she has 1 or less stares in which she was seen, she has a 25% chance to go into the Disappearing state (only rolled once per staring). If she doesn't switch states and the target gets within a range of 5 units, and she has 2 or more stares in which she was looked at (including this one, because getting within 5 units counts as looking at her) then she will roll a second independent 64% chance to go into the Chasing state, on top of the 85% chance, if it occurs. If she doesn't begin to chase when her target moves within 5 units of her, she will switch to the Vanishing state. Additionally, if a non-targeted player touches her in this state, she will switch to the Vanishing state.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Disappearing</h3>
            <p>In this state, the ghost girl tries to "walk offscreen". She selects an out of sight spot, and walks to it. The moment she gets out of line of sight to the player (foliage materials don't matter), or within 4 units of the target player, or within 0.2 units of her destination, she becomes invisible and switches back to the Absent state. If a non-target player touches her in this state, or if she fails to select a spot, she will switch to the Vanishing state.</p>
            <p>She selects a spot by casting a ray up to 8 units to her right, and checking if it makes contact with a surface. If the spot of contact is out of line of sight to the targeted player (foliage materials don't matter), and brings her at most 1 unit closer to the targeted player, she will select the nearest AI navigation node to that point. Otherwise, she tries again by casting a ray diagonally to her back-right, then to her back, etc, for all 8 directions around her. If none of the 8 rays work, she checks each AI navigation node within a 7 unit sphere of her, and drops the "at most 1 unit closer" requirement. If none of these are valid either, she fails to select a spot.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Vanishing</h3>
            <p>In this state, she immediately turns invisible and switches to the Absent state, but makes lights and flashlights flicker for a short time afterward.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Chasing</h3>
            <p>In this state, she pursues the target player, and if she touches them, they die. The chase lasts 20 seconds, or until the target player moves more than 50 units away from her. When it ends, she will return to the Absent state. Every 5 seconds, if the player is not looking at her (foliage matters, must be within 100 units and facing within 70 degrees of her direction, or within 10 units and facing any direction), she will try to teleport by using the code from the Absent state to select a location, but this time allowing locations that have no line of sight to the target player. Because it uses the same code, if she is unseen and then tries to select a location and fails, it will make the next Absent state skip its 20 second timer, so the ghost girl will reappear in its staring state sooner next time. If her target dies, she will select a new target, and the new target will have its own separate counters and timers and states for her, so she will be in the Absent state again with 0 stares in which she was seen or unseen.</p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li>Approaching the ghost girl while being haunted may cause her to temporarily disappear, but it is not advisable.</li>
                <li>Though only haunted players can directly see the Ghost Girl, an image of her will show up on the ship's CCTV.</li>
                <li>The ghost girl is the rarest entity in the game as of Version 47.</li>
                <li>The ghost girl is immune to all damage and can't be stunned.</li>
                <li>She can appear and kill haunted players anywhere, including inside the ship.</li>
                <li>It's possible that the ghost girl is based on Alma Wade from the F.E.A.R. Series.</li>
                <li>The ghost girl and <a href="masked.html">masked</a> are the only entities that can exit the factory.</li>
                <li>Quiet girlish vocalizations (such as a gentle “Hi” or "Hey") with no apparent source don't actually indicate being haunted, these are random sounds that just play as ambience.</li>
                <li>Nearby lights will reactivate briefly and flicker during a haunting when there is no power in the facility.</li>
            </ul>
