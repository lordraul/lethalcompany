			<h1>Hoarding Bug</h1>
            <p><span class="bold">Hoarding Bugs</span> are insectoid <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. They are commonly referred to as "Loot Bugs" due to their tendency to collect scrap much like the players.</p>

            <hr>
            <div class="bestiary">
                <p>Hoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.</p>
                <p>Hoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral and pose little danger.</p>
                <p>Hoarding bugs will attack you if you get too close for too long. We love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - this has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd</p>

                <li>Linepithema-crassus roughly translates to "gross thing" in Latin. Linepithema is also the name of a genus of small ants in the real world.
