            <p><span class="bold">Manticoils</span> are harmless, bird-like <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. Characterized by their set of four wings, they're commonly found flying through the air, or as groups on the ground. They will disperse into the sky when approached or otherwise frightened by a player.</p>

                <p>Manticoils are a passerine bird of the family Corvidae. Their bodies are quite large compared to their early descendants, and their wingspan ranges from 55 to 64 inches. Their most defining characteristic is their set of four wings. Their back wings are mostly used to stabilize when at low speed, while their front two wings create the majority of lift. Their round bodies are a striking yellow but with black outlines or stripes along their primary (rear) feathers.</p>
                <p>Manticoils mostly feed on small insects but can also feed on small rodents. They are highly intelligent and social. They pose little threat and have a generally passive temperament towards humans, although they are capable of transmitting Rabies, Rubenchloria, and Pitt Virus.</p>
