			<h1>Bunker Spider</h1>
            <p><span class="bold">Bunker Spiders</span> are large arachnid <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. They are quite aggressive and territorial, wandering the facility, placing webs to trap prey. When a player touches one of its webs, it is alerted and will attempt to hunt down the player in question.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Bestiary</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="bestiary">
                <p>Bunker spiders, of the genus Theraphosa, are the largest arachnid found in the Thistle Nebula and the second largest ever discovered. It's believed they evolved to prey on large mammals over the course of a measly several hundred years after the Boat made its trip around the Thistle Nebula. (Refer to: Speculation on Increased Speciation Around the Fading Nebulae)</p>
                <p>Bunker spiders produce silk and lay it around their chosen nesting area, then wait for it to be tripped on. They can be seen waiting on walls, often over doorways where prey could enter unaware. If you find a bunker spider 'unprepared' it may freeze as a defensive reaction. In this case they are best left alone. If a bunker spider reacts aggressively, it is best not to fight with ordinary tools. They use their webs to make up for their rather slow movement, so take note of your surroundings. Their webs can be broken easily with any blunt tool.</p>
                <p>Bunker spiders can pose a great danger to humans and urban explorers especially, without a great benefit to their ecosystems. A resulting kill-on-sight order has been informally agreed upon between many states home to the Bunker spider, and it is currently approved by the ITDA as of 10/6/1965.</p>

                <li>If arachnophobia mode is turned on, all bunker spider models are replaced by a floating red text saying "Spider".</li>
                <li>When an employee is killed by a Bunker Spider, their corpse dragged to its nesting spot and then wrapped up in the Bunker Spider's silk, disabling the ability to grab it.

                        <li>The corpse can be recovered if you use the Teleporter, though you still cannot grab it until the ship leaves.</li>
