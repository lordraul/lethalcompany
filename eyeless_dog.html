			<h1>Eyeless Dog</h1>
            <p><span class="bold">Eyeless Dogs</span> are large, canid <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. Though blind, they possess powerful hearing and can kill players in a single hit. This, alongside the possibility of multiple spawning at once and their ability to enter the ship, makes them one of the most dangerous monsters in the game; easily able to end the runs of interns.</p>

            <hr>
            <div class="bestiary">
                <p>"A large mammal of the class Saeptivus. They are social, hunting in very large packs. They have also been called “breathing lions” for their recognizable sound and large mouths. They are endurance hunters and attempt to make up for their lack of sight with their sense of hearing. It's a popular myth that they often mistake the sounds of their own kind for prey, entering fights within their own packs."</p>
                <p>"Their behaviour is unique from other pack animals in their tendency to spread out far to cover distance. When an eyeless dog has found prey, it roars to alert others in the near vicinity, who will also sound the alarm, sometimes resulting in a kind of chain reaction. Eyeless dogs can be dangerous in swarms. However, they are characteristically clumsy, taking guesses at their prey's exact location which are often incorrect."</p>

            <ul>
                <li>They have different levels of "alertness" depending on how much sound is occurring nearby.
                    <ul>
                        <li>First level: they wander, where they will simply move about aimlessly.</li>
                        <li>Second level: they perk their tails and heads up and growl, moving towards the general direction of noise heard. This can be surprisingly generous, with some intensely loud noises such as air horns not triggering their attack but their second level.</li>
                        <li>Third level: they roar and attack, running and lunging wildly towards the direction of the noise. This also alerts other dogs, often launching them into attack as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Eyeless Dogs can climb the stairs of Titan.</li>
                <li>Baboon Hawks and Eyeless Dogs will fight in the rare circumstance they're both spawned in.</li>
                <li>Once in their third aggression level, they can occasionally attack players that haven't even made any noise, forgoing the player that initially aggravated them. This behavior is not believed to be intentional.</li>
            </ul>
