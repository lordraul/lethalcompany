            <p><span class="bold">Forest Giants</span> are <a href="entities.html">entities</a> in <a href="index.html" class="italic">Lethal Company</a>. They are colossal and extremely quick, eating Employees they can get their hands on. They have great eyesight, but are incapable of hearing.</p>

                <p>Believed to share a common ancestor with rapax-folium, these behemoths are called Forest Keepers for the biomes they often inhabit. THeir bodies bare markings on their front and back which mimic eyes--this trait is more helpful in their youth, as they are not agile. Their skin is a unique, dense material which hardens further throughout their lives; the large spikes and bumps across their bodies form as a result of aging</p>
                <p>It's been said that Forest Keepers don't actually need to put anything inside their mouths, and it's theorized their main source of energy is a process similar to photosynthesis. Still, this makes them relatively dangerous to observe. They can see across long distances, so staying low and making use of cover is a must. They cannot enter small spaces and are not generally destructive, so stay close to shelter or overhangs.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="italic">Satyrid-proceritas</span> translates to "A satirical prodigy" in Latin, which is very unclear. However, <span class="italic">Satyrid</span> may refer to a subfamily of the <span class="italic">Nymphalidae</span> family of butterflies. Many butterfly species have eyespot markings, which are primarily defensive in nature much like the eye-like markings on a Forest Giant. "Satyrid" literally means "Satyr-like" in scientific Latin, referring to Satyrs, a group of forest dwelling deitie in Greek mythology that are part-man and part-goat.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="italic">proceritas</span> means height or tallness, referencing the entity's massive size.</li>
                    </ul>
